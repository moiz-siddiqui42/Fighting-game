# Dynamic Fighting Game by Moiz Siddiqui, Click this link to play: moiz-siddiqui-fighter-game.netlify.app

A **Street Fighter-inspired game** built using **JavaScript** and **HTML**, with dynamic gameplay modes for **Single Player** and **Multiplayer**. This project provides an engaging fighting experience with animated sprites, health bar mechanics, and responsive controls.

## **Features**

### **Gameplay Modes**
- **Single Player**: Play against a computer-controlled opponent. The computer has its own health bar and attack mechanics.
- **Multiplayer**: Play against a friend with dedicated controls for both players.

### **Mechanics**
- **Health Bar System**: Each fighter has a health bar that depletes when hit. The game ends when one fighter's health bar reaches zero.
- **Attack Functionality**: Each player can swing at their opponent to deal damage. Animated sprites enhance the fighting experience.
- **Dynamic Restart**: After a game ends, players are prompted to either replay or quit.

### **Controls**
- **Single Player**:
  - Player: Arrow keys for movement and actions.
- **Multiplayer**:
  - Player 1: Arrow keys for movement and actions.
  - Player 2: WASD keys for movement and actions.

### **Graphics**
- **Sprite Animations**: Smooth transitions for swings, movements, and attacks using pre-designed sprites.

### **Live Server Requirement**
- The game requires the **Live Server extension** for proper execution. This can be run directly through the repository if cloned locally.

## **How to Run**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moiz-siddiqui42/Fighting-game.git

   ```
3. Open the game in Live Server:
   - Ensure you have the **Live Server extension** installed in your code editor (e.g., VS Code).
   - Right-click on `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"**.

## **Additional Notes**
